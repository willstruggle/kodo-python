    Encode recode decode example.

    In Network Coding applications, one of the key features is the
    ability of intermediate nodes in the network to recode packets
    as they traverse them. In Kodo it is possible to recode packets
    in decoders which provide the produce_payload() function.

    This example shows how to use one encoder and two decoders to
    simulate a simple relay network as shown below:

            +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
            |  encoder  |+--->|  recoder  |+--->|  decoder  |
            +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+

    In a practical application recoding can be used in several different
    ways and one must consider several different factors, such as
    reducing linear dependency by coordinating several recoding nodes
    in the network.
    Suggestions for dealing with such issues can be found in current
    research literature (e.g. MORE: A Network Coding Approach to
    Opportunistic Routing).
